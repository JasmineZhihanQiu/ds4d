### Audience

The audience is within the Ideal project for now

IDEAL’s current team 

- [Dr. Nigel Goddard](http://www.energyoracle.org/nigel-goddard.html) (PI) provides overall guidance and coordination for the project and contributes to all the components. He directs the Machine Learning component. 
- [Prof. Johanna Moore](http://www.energyoracle.org/johanna-moore.html) leads the Multimodal Feedback component. 
- [Prof. Jan Webb](http://www.energyoracle.org/jan-webb.html) leads the Study Design component, contributes to the Data Acquisition and Multimodal Feedback components. 
- [Elaine Farrow](http://www.energyoracle.org/elaine-farrow.html) and Edmund Farrow work with Johanna Moore to deliver the feedback channels including tablet and web apps in the Multimodal Feedback component. 
- [Jonathan Kilgour](http://www.energyoracle.org/jonathan-kilgour.html) works with Nigel Goddard to construct and maintain the data pipeline in the Data Acquisition component, develop the BIGSMALL enhanced sensor system, and contribute to the Multimodal Feedback component. 
- [Dr. Lynda Webb](http://www.energyoracle.org/lynda-webb.html) and [Dr. Evan Morgan](http://www.energyoracle.org/evan-morgan.html) contributed to the co-design of the Multimodal Feedback components and qualitative data collection from participants. 
- [Dr. Martin Pullinger](http://www.energyoracle.org/martin-pullinger.html) provides day-to-day project management on the project and works on the Study Design, Data Acquistion and Multimodal Feedback components. 
- Niklas Berliner and Cillian Brewitt work with Nigel Goddard to deliver the Machine Learning component.

### Purpose

IDEAL’s work has centred around four core aims: 

1. Gathering a high-resolution household dataset: We developed and installed an ultra-low power wireless sensor network system in over 240 homes to collect high frequency home energy, temperature and humidity data over extended periods of time (months to years). 
2. Inferring energy using behaviours: Appliance-level energy monitors and improved machine learning methods allow us to identify patterns of home appliance use and to infer which everyday behaviours account for a home's energy usage. 
3. Understanding occupant behaviours: Our methodology of combining sensor data, machine learning inferences and survey data provides us with a long duration, high resolution dataset to investigate in great detail how everyday behaviours shape household energy use, and how these are influenced by socio-demographic, building, climatic and other factors.  
4. Enhanced energy feedback: Through a co-design approach with project participants we have developed a range of novel energy feedback tools and then evaluated their effects over extended periods of time in real homes, with real people, in a randomised controlled trial.

## Message

### Take-home Message

Improving our understanding of domestic energy demand - when, how much and on what people use energy in their homes - is one critical element of decarbonising the energy system and mitigating climate change.
